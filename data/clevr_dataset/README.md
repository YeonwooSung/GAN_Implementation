# CLEVR-SV Dataset

A subset of the CLEVR-SV dataset. This is given to show how our training and testing data are organized. 

clevr_dict.npy contains a dictionary, where the key is the image file name and the value is the attribute (conditional input) of the object.

For the full dataset, please refer to https://github.com/CrickWu/Clevr-for-StoryGAN . After generating the whole dataset, clevr_dict.npy and clevr_data.py needs to be updated according to the whole dataset.
